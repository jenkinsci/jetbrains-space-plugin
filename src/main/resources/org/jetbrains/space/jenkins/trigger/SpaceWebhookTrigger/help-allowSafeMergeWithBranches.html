    <p>Allows using the build for safe merge of a merge request in JetBrains SpaceCode.</p>

    <p>
        Safe merge lets you execute quality checks for a merge request on a temporary merge commit
        before actually integrating the merge request into the main branch.

        See the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/branch-and-merge-restrictions.html#safe-merge">JetBrains SpaceCode
        documentation</a> for more information about safe merge.
