    <p>Allows using the build for safe merge of a merge request in SpaceCode.</p>

    <p>Safe merge lets you execute quality checks for the merge request on the merge commit in the temporary merge
        branch,
        before actually integrating the merge request into the main branch.
        See <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/branch-and-merge-restrictions.html#safe-merge">SpaceCode
            documentation</a> for more information about safe merge.
