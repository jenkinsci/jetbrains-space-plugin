    <p>Merge request title must match the specified regular expression.</p>
    <p>Regular expression must match the entire merge request title, not just a part of it. For example, to exclude all merge requests with a title starting with "WIP" from triggering builds, specify <i>(?!WIP).+</i> as a regex.</p>
