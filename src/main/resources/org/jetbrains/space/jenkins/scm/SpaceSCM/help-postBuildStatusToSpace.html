    <p>If checked, Jenkins will automatically report the build to JetBrains Space. Adding any steps to the job or workflow definition will not be required.</p>
    <p>The build will be reported as running upon its start and as succeeded or failed upon its completion.</p>
    <p>Git commit and branch name for reporting will be taken from the GIT_COMMIT and GIT_BRANCH environment variables.
        These <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/git/#plugin-content-environment-variables">environment variables</a> are provided by the standard Jenkins Git plugin when source code is checked out from a git repository.</p>
